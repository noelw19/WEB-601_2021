Js engine is about 70% C language and 30% Jvascript.

We are talking about javascripts v8 engine and talking about the process it takes to be what it is.

![JS V8](https://des501.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F9956acd7-f69f-4bfe-b71d-50baf6ab0b77%2FUntitled.png?table=block&id=017966b5-9701-4e14-a8ee-a9cce38c23d1&spaceId=62744ba8-9f44-446e-913d-67d75f3437df&width=2000&userId=&cache=v2)

memory leaks come from callbacks - because it reserves memory space waiting for multiple callback results in memory bloating.

We also talked about NodeJs
- how it is a JS runtime and built on the v8 Js engine.
- can require express from node instead of intalling via NPM.
